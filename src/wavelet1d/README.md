Website : http://wavelet2d.sourceforge.net/

Preferred Download - https://sourceforge.net/projects/wavelet2d/files/wavelib-0.4.0.0/

Licensing and Dependencies -
These libraries are licensed under GNU-GPL v2.0 (or any later version). See COPYRIGHT and COPYING files for more information. These libraries statically and dynamically link to FFTW-3.2.2 static library, FFTW3-3.3 static libray and FFTw-3.2.2 dynamic libraries in different implementations. More information, fftw libraries and associated files for this version are available at www.fftw.org. I have not modified fftw source codes in any way shape or form so you may want to download copies of source code and other files from the FFTW website itself if you are so inclined.

Non FFTW Options - See the folders wavelib-nofftw and wavelib-nofftw-vs for options that don't need FFTW library. KissFFT is used instead. The latter option will work on visual studio.

Recommended Alternatives - A faster , completely self-contained implementation of 1D DWT,SWT and MODWT with BSD license is available at https://github.com/rafat/wavelib
