# LPCF
# This function creates a feedback comb filter with a LPF in the feedback
# path.
#
# Input Variables
#   n: current sample number of the input signal
#   delay: samples of delay
#   fbGain: feedback gain (linear scale)
#   amp: amplitude of LFO modulation
#   rate: frequency of LFO modulation
#   fbLPF: output delayed one sample to create basic LPF
#
# See also MOORERREVERB
