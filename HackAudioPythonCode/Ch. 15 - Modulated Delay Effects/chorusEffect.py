# CHORUSEFFECT
# This function can be used to create a chorus audio effect.
#
# Input variables
#   x: single sample of the input signal
#   buffer: used to store delayed samples of the signal
#   n: current sample number used for the LFO
#   depth: range of modulation (milliseconds)
#   rate: speed of modulation (frequency, Hz)
#   predelay: offset of modulation (milliseconds)
#   wet: percent of processed signal (dry = 100 - wet)
#
# See also VIBRATOEFFECT, FLANGEREFFECT
