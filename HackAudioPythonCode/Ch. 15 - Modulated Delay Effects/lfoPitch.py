# LFOPITCH
# This script demonstrates an example of pitch shifting using a sawtooth LFO
# to modulate delay time. The result is a signal that has been pitch shifted
# based on the 'semitones' variable.
#
# An important aspect of this algorithm is to avoid having the processed
# signal to be a different length than the original signal. To make this
# possible, the maximum delay time is 50 ms. A sawtooth LFO is used to
# modulate the delay time between 0ms and 50ms based on the necessary rate
# of change. If the delay time is about to go outside of this range, a new
# cycle of the sawtooth begins.
#
# The output signal has audible clicks and pops due to the discontinuities
# of the modulated delay. This motivates the use of two parallel delay lines
# that crossfade back and forth to smooth over the discontinuities.
