# LUFS
# This function calculates the loudness of a mono or stereo
# audio signal based on the LUFS/LKFS standard. The analysis
# involves multiple steps. First, the input signal is
# processed using the pre-filter followed by the RLB filter.
# Then, a mean-square calculation is performed. Finally,
# all the channels are summed together and loudness is converted
# to units of decibels (dB).
#
# See also LUFSEXAMPLE
