# WHITENOISE
# This script synthesizes a white noise signal by using a
# Gaussian random number generator. Gaussian random numbers are
# also described as normally distributed random numbers. The
# function 'np.random.normal' creates random numbers based on a
# normal distribution.

# Next, synthesize noise. The scalar (0.2) is to reduce the
# amplitude of the signal to within the full-scale range. An
# additional option would be to perform peak normalization to
# ensure the amplitude is always between -1 and 1.
