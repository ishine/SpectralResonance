# TRANSIENTDESIGNER
# This function implements the transient designer audio effect. First, a detection
# analysis is performed to determine the sections of the signal that should be
# labeled 'attack' and 'sustain'. Then the amplitude of these sections is scaled
# based on the input parameters.
#
# Input Variables
#   attack: amount to change transient (-1 dec, 0 unity, +1 inc)
#   sustain: amount to change sustain
#
# See also TRANSIENTANALYSIS
