# Couatl
Spectrum Skywalker

# There are two kinds of sounds
* That which is real and physics
* That which is imaginary and is or is not physics

# If it is imaginary yet you hear it
* Then it has to be physics somehow

# FFTW
* Essentail Fourier Maths
* All the algorithms of the fouriers

# AudioFFT
* FFTW Real fft
* FFTW Convolution

# Essentia
* use it to make the spectral algorithms

# Loris
* use it to morph sounds

# CSound
* has alot of algorithms for making sounds

# Octave
* MATrix LABoratory Compatible 

# There alot of others codes
* I find them and collect them
